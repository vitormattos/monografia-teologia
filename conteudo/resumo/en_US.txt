This research begins with the centrality of Christian fellowship to reflect on the ethical dilemmas arising from the increasing use of technology in churches. Fellowship, as expressed in the Westminster Confession of Faith, chapter 26, represents more than mere coexistence; it is the visible expression of love for one another and unity in the body of Christ. However, it can be seriously compromised by irresponsible technological practices, especially in the handling of sensitive data and member images.

Improper use of technology, without the necessary ethical care, can lead to data leaks, legal actions, and, above all, a breakdown of trust among church members, directly undermining the experience of fellowship. Neglecting data protection laws not only exposes the church to legal penalties but also violates fundamental biblical principles such as care and responsibility in dealing with others.

Based on the Christian ethics revealed in Scripture, this research affirms that the Christian commitment must also encompass the responsible use of technology. Faithfulness to Godâ€™s Word requires an ethical and vigilant posture when facing the challenges of the digital age, in order to safeguard the integrity of the church and the witness of the gospel.

Finally, the study proposes guidelines for ethical digital governance, aimed at protecting privacy, preserving fellowship among the saints, and maintaining the integrity of the Christian testimony in an increasingly technological world.
